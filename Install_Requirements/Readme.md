# Installation Requirements:

In this foder are two installers, one for 32bit os and one for 64bit os. they require Admin access to install and won't be required
unless the sql server is pointed to a MySQL database.

## To install the ODBC Drivers:

simply double click on the driver install for the version of windows that this system is installed on, and follow the prompts.
AGAIN Admin privlages will be required to complete the install. PLease plan ahead for IT delays.

When the install is completed you wont have to redo the install until a new computer is set up OR if something happens to one computer.
If using SQL Server by Microsoft you will not need to install the MYSQL ODBC driver.
