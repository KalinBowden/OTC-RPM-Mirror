## Install Requrements AKA Dependencies:
We have written the application in such a way so as to allow the connection to connect to a MySQL database. In order to complete the connection an ODBC driver must be present on the compuer where the application is being installed to. This driver allows for the connection between the application and the MySQL database engine. We have included the required installers that will allow you to communicate with a MySQL database. The installers are for either 32bit or 64bit Windows os. these installer require administratior permission or password to install. You may not ever need to install these drivers if you only are using MSSQL database engines. If you are unsure which version of the MySQL ODBC driver to install we recommend that you have both the 32bit and 64bit drivers installed.
Each computer running the software if connecting to MySQL will require that the ODBC driver(s) be installed on them.

## Ensure that your ODBC driver for MSSQL is installed on your computer:
It may be the case that you have not had the proper driver for MSSQL, this is unlikly, but in the event that it is the case please use the MSSQL ODBC 13.0 driver (32/64bit) driver to allow connections to MSSQL based servers.
